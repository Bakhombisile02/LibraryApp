# Description

The LibraryApp is an educational software designed to make learning about library systems engaging and enjoyable. Its primary objectives are to assist users in:

- Identifying the broad area to which a book belongs.
- Finding the call number for a specific topic.
- Correctly replacing a book in its designated position on a shelf.

Librarians often need to sort call numbers in numerical and then alphabetical order when placing books on shelves. This software aims to facilitate this process.

# Features

- **Finding Call Number Feature:**
  - Navigate down the level of a tree using the Dewey Decimal System.
  - Understand the fundamentals of trees through this interactive feature.
- Categorize books into broad areas.
- Generate call numbers for specific topics.
- Simulate book placement on shelves for practice.
- **Identifying Areas Task:**
  - Quiz users on matching call numbers with their corresponding category and subcategory.
  - Users can answer as many questions as they want.
  - Questions alternate between matching descriptions to call numbers and call numbers to descriptions.
  - Each question presents four randomly selected items with seven possible answers (including three incorrect ones).
- **Gamification Elements:**
  - Timer to measure sorting speed.
  - Background music for an immersive experience.
  - Score tracking to encourage progress and improvement.
  - Limited lives (3 attempts per session) for added challenge.

# Experimentation with Data Structures and Algorithms

- Import call numbers from the "Library.txt" file.
- Experiment with data structures and algorithms, including quicksort and trees.

# Coding Standards

I've incorporated valuable feedback from my lecturer to enhance coding standards:
- Utilized `var` for improved type inference.
- Implemented XML comments for comprehensive code documentation.
